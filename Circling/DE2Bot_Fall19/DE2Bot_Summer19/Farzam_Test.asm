; Mult16s:  16x16 -> 32-bit signed multiplication
; Based on Booth's algorithm.
; Written by Kevin Johnson.  No licence or copyright applied.
; Warning: does not work with factor B = -32768 (most-negative number).
; To use:
; - Store factors in m16sA and m16sB.
; - Call Mult16s
; - Result is stored in mres16sH and mres16sL (high and low words)

	STORE  m16sA
	STORE  m16sB
	CALL   A2_mult      ; X^2
	STORE  m16sA
	LOAD   A2c
	STORE  m16sB
	CALL   A2_mult
	
	
	CALL   Mult16s
	LOAD   mres16sH
	SHIFT  8            ; move high word of result up 8 bits
	STORE  mres16sH
	LOAD   mres16sL

	SHIFT  -8           ; move low word of result down 8 bits
	AND    LowByte
	OR     mres16sH     ; combine high and low words of result
	RETURN
